1. What is Event Stream?
 - Event streaming is the practice of capturing data in  realtime from event sources.
 - Sources can be databases,sensors,mobile devices, cloud services and software applications.
 - Storing these event streams durably for later retrieval, manipulating, processing and reacting to the event streams in realtime as well as retrospectively . and routing the event stream to different destination technologies as needed.
 - Using Event Stream we can keep right information at right place at right time.

 2. Why Messaging Systems ?
 - Problem : Collecting all the data is not easy as data is generated from various sources in different formats
 - Solution : One of the ways to solve this problem is to use messaging system. Messaging systems provide a seamless integration between distributed applications with the help of messages.

 3. What is Apache kafka ?
 - Apache kafka is distibuted streaming platform
 - Apache kafka is used to process real time data feeds with high throughput and low letency
   Ex- Flights data, sensors data, stocks data, news data, user activities etc...
 - Kafka works based on publisher and subscriber model
 - kafka was originally developed at linkedin in 2011

 4. How kafka works ?
 - Apache kafka is a distibuted streaming platform
 - At its core, it allows systems that generate data(called producers) to persist their data in realtime in an apache kafka topic.
 - Any topic can then be read by any number of systems who need that data in real-time(called consumers)
 - Kafka is a Pub/Sub system. Behind the scenes, kafka is distributed, scales well , replicates data across brokers ( servers), can survive broker downtime and much more.
