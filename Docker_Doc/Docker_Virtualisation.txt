Virtualization:-
----------------
It is the technique of splitting a physical resource into as many logical resource as we want.
ex: cpu
Virtualization is a technology to transform hardware into software.

Hypervisor is a piece of software or firmware that create and run virtual machine hypervisor is sometimes also called a virtual machine manager.

Types of Hypervisor
1. Type-1 Hypervisor/Bare Metal/ Native Hypervisor
 Defination: 
 -> it run directly on the system hardware . a guest OS runs on another level above the hypervisor.
 -> VMware ESXi is a Type-1 hypervisor that runs on the host server hardware without an underlying OS
 -> Type-1 Hypervisor act as their own OS.
 -> ESXi provides a virtualization layer that abstracts the CPU,storage,memory and networking resources of the physical host into multiple virtual machine.
2. Type-2 Hypervisor/Hosted Hypervisor
Defination:
->Hypervisor that runs within a conventional OS environment, and the host OS provides
-> Ex VMware workstatin, Oracle VirtualBox,,Microsoftwa virtual PC
->It foes not have direct access to the host hardware and resources.

Docker
---------
Defination:
-> Docker is an open-source centralised platform designed to create,deploy and run application.
-> Docker uses container on the host OS to run application .it allows application to use the same linux kernel as a system on the host computer, rather than creating a whole virtual OS.
-> WE can install docker on any OS but docker engine runs natively on linux distribution.
-> Docker written in  "Go" langualge.
-> Docker is atool that perform OS level virtualization , also known as containerzation.
-> Before docker, many user faces the problem that a particular code is running in the developers system but not in the User's system.
-> Docker was first release in march 2013.
It is developed by solomin hykes and sebstian pahi.
-> Docker is a set of platform as a service that user OS level virtualization where as vmware uses hardware level virtualization.
